## dotfiles 

These are my personal configs that I use daily to customize my setup. Feel free to explore and use them to enhance your own.
Currently, I use [Arcolinux](https://arcolinux.com) with the [BSPWM](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) window manager on my main machine.

You can apply these configurations by either copy pasting the individual files or using [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow).
